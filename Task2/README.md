Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

  - The metadata organization is clear and well structured.
  - Although missing values were removed for certain calculations, replacing -200 with NaN during the EDA stage is more appropriate for preserving data integrity. The inclusion of a missing rate summary strengthens the data quality assessment.
  - The missing value handling procedure is generalizable and could be modularized into a function for improved code clarity and reusability.
  - For the correlation analysis, examining time- or season-specific correlations, as well as relationships among additional variables, may provide further insight into potential drift patterns and underlying structure in the dataset.
