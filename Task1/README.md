Each group member should provide feedback on the other group members’ work. Be detailed and specific where possible. The quality of this feedback can play a part in your grade.

You can provide feedback to your group members in many different ways (live in a meeting, offline, or however else you devise) but the feedback must be documented here! 

Please replace “Feedback giver #x” with a group member’s name below and add feedback as a bulleted list below. Note: There is a pencil icon on the top right of the README file (when you are viewing the README.md file) that allows you to edit.

  + This is impressive. I'll write more tomorrow, but wanted to meet the deadline today.
  + I'm wondering if we should drop observations of a sensor until the final analysis phase. For example, in my EDA I replaced -200 with NaN, then did summary statistics on them. I get that if a sensor is offline for a long period of time,we may not want to use those in an analysis. However, if it's merely a glitch in the sensor for some small amount of time, is there an imputation strategy we could use?
